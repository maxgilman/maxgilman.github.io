turn while dashing
dash has to be charged, so you preplan your inputs and do them all in quick seccusion
particle effects(lots of blood)
miku skin
easter egg where all sound effects go though the miku sound generator
variable bullet range

totorial and how well you do changes the difficulty for the rest of the game
Maybe how you're doing in the game changes the difficulty
more health for all enemies (espicially the normal pathfinding ones)
walls so you can't advance without killing everything
enemy that runs away
limit on speed upgrades

variable bullet speed on player and enemies
Shop
Dash doesn't scale with speed
Something at the end after you beat the boss like "you won" or stats screen
homing bullets, their homing strength could be upgradeable
Bombs as another pillar style
r should restart the game
Upgrades feel more material (you suck up the upgrade?)
Better graphics
Add shield (hitting enemies heals the sheild)
Choice of upgrade between the main upgrade catagories
Show how enemies move defferently?
Knockback on your shots upgrade
Make AI miss (test with more playtesting to see if this is needed)
Shooting stuns the enemies
Despawn animation on summoned enemy should look better
Bullets should have effects (like enemies)
Maybe you don't have to run to the center of the room to grab the upgrade somehow
change the level when you come in from the right and leftto have easier pathways so it doesn't lag as much
boss is really hard with 10 max diff
bullets don't hurt boss?
buff green enemy speed
cheese kill boss on wall (bullets dissappear on frame 1 and miss you)
fix dash on different frame rates
upgrade that makes any enemy you kill go onto your team (maybe only a chance of happening)
enemy with sheild that needs line of sight to turn the sheild (meant to encourage flanking)(enemy can't itself shoot)
enemies (espically boss)show how much health they have left?
screen shake
freeze when you shoot or get hit or hit an enemy
audio

Upgrade could be a really good enemy teammate
One could be a healer that sits back and throws healing potions at you
Maybe you can still summon weaker enemies with a botton press but they're a limit or thet don't stay with you
