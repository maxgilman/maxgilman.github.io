turn while dashing
dash has to be charged, so you preplan your inputs and do them all in quick seccusion
particle effects(lots of blood)
miku skin
easter egg where all sound effects go though the miku sound generator
variable bullet range

totorial and how well you do changes the difficulty for the rest of the game
Maybe how you're doing in the game changes the difficulty
enemy that runs away
limit on speed upgrades

Shop
Dash doesn't scale with speed
Stats after you beat the final boss
Upgrades feel more material (you suck up the upgrade?)
Better graphics
Choice of upgrade? between the main upgrade catagories
Show how enemies move differently?
Knockback on your shots upgrade
Make AI miss (test with more playtesting to see if this is needed)
Shooting stuns the enemies
Bullets should have effects (like enemies)
Maybe you don't have to run to the center of the room to grab the upgrade somehow
cheese kill boss on wall (bullets dissappear on frame 1 and miss you)(can happen to other enemies too)
fix dash on different frame rates
enemy with sheild that needs line of sight to turn the sheild (meant to encourage flanking)(enemy can't itself shoot)
enemies (espically boss)show how much health they have left?
screen freeze when you shoot or get hit or hit an enemy(to emphasize the impact)
audio
power up shows up on you and you don't see what it is(make it take time before you can pick it up)
bullets that are never visible shake the screen (maybe give more of an indicator that the enemy actually shot it)(particles?)
enemies have more health but no visual indicator that they have more health
when you dash backwards into a wall and shoot the bullet dissapears on frame one
multiple enemies spawning at the same spawner(bad?)
boss needs more depth(and it's too easy)
when an enemy dies it should spew out lots of particles(blood)
particle when a bullet hits anything
upgarde that makes more health things drop(might not work because it's needed at the beginning when you don't have it, but not at the end when you do have it)(maybe remove invincability frames so people take more damage in endgame?)
upgrade that lets you suck up tiny upgrades
Set up bulletwallcollision with enemyrooms so it only checks the needed walls, not every wall
add an image of the weapon on the weapon select screen
boss should have a more unique reward
make better pathfinding that doesn't generate the boxes every time, it uses a preset web
limit on gun reload upgrades?

sniper have unique upgrade where every enemy you pierce makes it do more damage(encourages lining up enemies to snipe em all at once)

different weapons like shotgun and sniper and grenade laucher and machine gun and magic staff?
magic staff (lighting(chains between enemies), explosives, metal(bullets),water(knockback))
water shoots you back(like the dash)(maybe you charge up a big ball of water)
choice of weapon at beginning of run(upgrade could repersent the weapon and make the other options dissapear)
homing bullets, their homing strength could be upgradeable
Bombs as another pillar style

Upgrade could be a really good enemy teammate
One could be a healer that sits back and throws healing potions at you
Maybe you can still summon weaker enemies with a botton press but they're a limit or thet don't stay with you
control two guys and they both respond to your bottom presses, have to navigate them through a maze
Despawn animation on summoned enemy should look better
upgrade that makes any enemy you kill go onto your team (maybe only a chance of happening)

Add shield (hitting enemies heals the sheild)
