totorial and how well you do changes the difficulty for the rest of the game
Maybe how you're doing in the game changes the difficulty
enemy that runs away
limit on speed upgrades
turn while dashing
dash has to be charged, so you preplan your inputs and do them all in quick seccusion
miku skin


Shop
Dash doesn't scale with speed
Stats after you beat the final boss
Better graphics
Choice of upgrade? between the main upgrade catagories
Show how enemies move differently?
Knockback on your shots upgrade
Make AI miss (test with more playtesting to see if this is needed)
Shooting stuns the enemies
Bullets should have effects (like enemies)
Maybe you don't have to run to the center of the room to grab the upgrade somehow
cheese kill boss on wall (bullets dissappear on frame 1 and miss you)(can happen to other enemies too)
enemy with sheild that needs line of sight to turn the sheild (meant to encourage flanking)(enemy can't itself shoot)
enemies (espically boss)show how much health they have left?
screen freeze when you shoot or get hit or hit an enemy(to emphasize the impact)
audio
power up shows up on you and you don't see what it is(make it take time before you can pick it up)
bullets that are never visible shake the screen (maybe give more of an indicator that the enemy actually shot it)(particles?)
enemies have more health but no visual indicator that they have more health(this might be ok)(what if enemies only power up after bosses)
when you dash backwards into a wall and shoot the bullet dissapears on frame one
multiple enemies spawning at the same spawner(bad?)
boss needs more depth(and it's too easy)
when an enemy dies it should spew out lots of particles(blood)
particle when a bullet hits anything
upgrade that makes more health things drop(might not work because it's needed at the beginning when you don't have it, but not at the end when you do have it)(maybe remove invincability frames so people take more damage in endgame?)
upgrade that lets you suck up tiny upgrades
add an image of the weapon on the weapon select screen
boss should have a more unique reward
make better pathfinding that doesn't generate the boxes every time, it uses a preset web
limit on gun reload upgrades?
enemy that charges at you and doesn't turn
windup on machine gun
enemies shouldn't walk striaght at you(machine gun and sniper tears them to bits too easily)
sniper have unique upgrade where every enemy you pierce makes it do more damage(encourages lining up enemies to snipe em all at once)
make enemy that has full pathfinding but if it has line of sight it moves like the pink enemy
add explosions (suicide bomber and weapon)
test enemy shooting through walls (I don't know what this means)(I think the enemies can shoot through walls like what happened to Miles)
add fast mode(less rooms but the power ups are stronger to compensate)
bullet spread doean't help enough with shotgun
He peeks out from a wall with the shotgun for a easy hit
shotgun range upgrade (The max isn't very high)
When he is on low health he plays defensive and boring (more health drops?)
The enemies clump on walls(bad?)
different weapons like  grenade laucher 
homing bullets, their homing strength could be upgradeable
Bombs as another pillar style
add blood or something that spews out of enemies that is really satifiying to run and collect like the lego games studs
try removing health and see what happens
you can have 5 power ups active at the bottom and 5 more in your inventory, not active
when you try to pick up one you don't have space for, it says something and you have to rearrage your upgrades to be ready
maybe your first upgrade is twice as powerful?
if you hold 3 directional buttons, they don't cancel out and you move diaganolly
improce screen shake, make it more thoughtful instead of just random

magic staff? (lighting(chains between enemies), explosives, metal(bullets),water(knockback))
water shoots you back(like the dash)(maybe you charge up a big ball of water)
Upgrade could be a really good enemy teammate
One could be a healer that sits back and throws healing potions at you
Maybe you can still summon weaker enemies with a botton press but there's a limit or thet don't stay with you
control two guys and they both respond to your bottom presses, have to navigate them through a maze
upgrade that makes any enemy you kill go onto your team (maybe only a chance of happening)
Add shield (hitting enemies heals the sheild)
game where the screen rotates and you have to find the player?
you have to scroll the screen to follow the player, the camera doesn't move
steal enemies ability(steal bosses ability to shoot multiple bullets)
you can use the enemies soul as a power up for you, or summon it as a minnon

Power up ideas
you are invincable for longer
you do more damage while invincable right after taking damage
dash
dash makes you invincable
shoot through infinite enemies
each enemy your bullet goes through, the damage doubles
berserker, more damge on lower health
bullet speed
enemies drop more health
turn escess health into something usefull
bombs
chance of a bullet doing a crit with nice sound or turning into something cool
more damage on full health
more autoaim
press button to enter barbarian mode where you heal from damage and barbarian mode is extended when this happens(maybe this is a potion or something)
more range
bullets move as fast as you are moving
bullet speed is porportional to how much damage they do
go faster
become more accurate

trade offs
less range but more bullets(maybe something else)
less fire rate but more damage
less damage but more fire rate
half health, but you take less damge and maybe something else
no auto Aim(maybe also a benifit)
become less accurate but shoot more bullets(or maybe replace that with another advantage)
