totorial and how well you do changes the difficulty for the rest of the game
Maybe how you're doing in the game changes the difficulty
enemy that runs away
turn while dashing
dash has to be charged, so you preplan your inputs and do them all in quick seccusion
miku skin

Shop
Stats after you beat the final boss
Better graphics
Show how enemies move differently?
Knockback on your shots upgrade
Make AI miss (test with more playtesting to see if this is needed)
Shooting stuns the enemies(this would be an upgrade)
cheese kill boss on wall (bullets dissappear on frame 1 and miss you)(can happen to other enemies too)
enemy with sheild that needs line of sight to turn the sheild (meant to encourage flanking)(enemy can't itself shoot)
enemies (espically boss)show how much health they have left?
screen freeze when you shoot or get hit or hit an enemy(to emphasize the impact)
audio
bullets that are never visible shake the screen (maybe give more of an indicator that the enemy actually shot it)(particles?)
enemies have more health but no visual indicator that they have more health(this might be ok)(what if enemies only power up after bosses)
when you dash backwards into a wall and shoot the bullet dissapears on frame one
boss needs more depth
particle when a bullet hits anything
upgrade that lets you suck up tiny upgrades
add an image of the weapon on the weapon select screen
boss should have a more unique reward
make better pathfinding that doesn't generate the boxes every time, it uses a preset web
limit on gun reload upgrades?
enemy that charges at you and doesn't turn
windup on machine gun
sniper have unique upgrade where every enemy you pierce makes it do more damage(encourages lining up enemies to snipe em all at once)
make enemy that has full pathfinding but if it has line of sight it moves like the pink enemy
add explosions (suicide bomber and weapon)
test enemy shooting through walls (I don't know what this means)(I think the enemies can shoot through walls like what happened to Miles)
add fast mode(less rooms but the power ups are stronger to compensate)
bullet spread doean't help enough with shotgun
He peeks out from a wall with the shotgun for a easy hit
When he is on low health he plays defensive and boring (more health drops?)
The enemies clump on walls(bad?)
different weapons like  grenade laucher 
homing bullets, their homing strength could be upgradeable
add blood or something that spews out of enemies that is really satifiying to run and collect like the lego games studs
when you try to pick up one you don't have space for, it says something and you have to rearrage your upgrades to be ready
maybe your first upgrade is twice as powerful?
if you hold 3 directional buttons, they don't cancel out and you move diaganolly
improce screen shake, make it more thoughtful instead of just random
you have an ult which power ups can change what it does, charged up killing enemies, maybe with the lego studs idea
make each upgrade an article of clothing so when you have a combo your charecter looks really funny
you shoot every frame so 60 fps shoots more than 30
enemy that has bullets fly away from it(reverse auto aim)
bullets shouldn't be able to shoot through a wall
remove ctx.save and restore with setTransform for performance

REVERSE MAGNET DOES damage 
special slot for weapon?(softlock where you don't have any weapons that do damage is too easy)
when a bullet hits a bomb the bomb explodes
make power ups not specific to a weapon. It doesn't feel good to only get power ups that are just objectively useless,
so turn weapon specific power ups into conditionals ex: bombs do double damage -> explosives do double damage
ex: dash heals you -> moving fast heals you(like REALLY fast)
power ups can take up multiple slots

magic staff? (lighting(chains between enemies), explosives, metal(bullets),water(knockback))
water shoots you back(like the dash)(maybe you charge up a big ball of water)
Upgrade could be a really good enemy teammate
One could be a healer that sits back and throws healing potions at you
Maybe you can still summon weaker enemies with a botton press but there's a limit or thet don't stay with you
control two guys and they both respond to your bottom presses, have to navigate them through a maze
upgrade that makes any enemy you kill go onto your team (maybe only a chance of happening)
Add shield (hitting enemies heals the sheild)
game where the screen rotates and you have to find the player?
you have to scroll the screen to follow the player, the camera doesn't move
steal enemies ability(steal bosses ability to shoot multiple bullets)
you can use the enemies soul as a power up for you, or summon it as a minnon
bullets spinning in a circle made very cool patterns that could be a puzzle?
you have a "deck" or cards 1-9 and one is always randomly drawn. upgrades effect what cards they are and maybe what status effects they do
You have to throw bombs that grow after a set time and the "exploding" bomb(an expanding player) pushs around circles to solve puzzles
You shoot to the beat of the music. maybe you make the music before each level to add startagy. maybe you can't even move and the only thing you have control over when you shoot, in ther words, what the music is
game where you're playing the economy like you're in the gilded age. playing other companies agaist each other
having the circles on the corners of the rotated bullets looks really satifiying on the bombs
every few rooms there is a challenge to mix it up

resource management
You can change what type of enemy an enemy is
make copies of yourself
parry bullets
bouncing shots
augmentations(minor upgrades can apply to anything) ex: damgage up could affect your bullets or your minions bullets
each major upgrades is a branch
an upgrde that is just a downside for a room then becomes an upgrade(take on a curse for x rooms and have a choice between 3 or so upgrades)

major upgrades are now guns that can all shoot all the bullets
but now each one has effects (maybe profeciency) in one area and a downside in another(ex: shoots another bullet for the shotgun bullet but sniper bullets do half damage)

bullets:
shotgun bullet
poison bullets
water (knockback bullets)(also makes electricity chain between further enemies)
bomb
bullet that splits into 4 smaller bullets
electricity(damage over time that chains)
bouncing bullet
burst of bullets(machine gun)
grapple hook?

Power up ideas
you are invincable for longer
you do more damage while invincable right after taking damage
dash
dash makes you invincable
jump?
shoot through infinite enemies
each enemy your bullet goes through, the damage doubles
you do more damge on lower health
more bullet speed
bullet speeds up as it travels
bullet slows down as it travels
enemies drop more health
turn escess health into something usefull(ult meter)
bombs (or mines)
the more enemies a bomb hits at once, the more damage it does
explosion damage up
chance of a bullet doing a crit with nice sound or turning into something cool
more damage on full health
more autoaim
more range
bullets move as fast as you are moving
bullet speed is porportional to how much damage they do
go faster
become more accurate
whenever you get a max health power up, heal to full
homing bullet(there is still bullet range)
another life after death, but you lose most or all of your power ups after death
each consecutive shot that hits an enemy does more damage(have to hold?)
invisibility
pull enemies to you (magnet)
push enemies away from you
every room cleared with this, do .5 more damage
turret you can place? shoots health at you?
flamethrower(bullets can leave a lingering flame)
the longer since the last shot, the more damage(up to a limit)(meant to encourage low fire rate builds, not wait in a room to charge up a shot)
bullets explode when hitting a wall(or maybe just on hitting an enemy)
wavy bullets
bullet kick(the amount the move back when shooting) is tripled

trade offs
less range but more bullets(maybe something else)
less fire rate but more damage
less damage but more fire rate
half health, but you take less damge and maybe something else
no auto Aim(maybe also a benifit)
become less accurate but shoot more bullets(or maybe replace that with another advantage)
unlimited screenShake
increased health but also increased size(you get hit more)
more bullets but less invincability frames

ult ideas:

huge explosion centered on you which has a long cooldown
barbarian mode where you heal from damage and barbarian mode is extended when this happens or extended when you get kills
can't move but shoot TONS of bullets(maybe little low damage)(fort knox blu jay idea)
move through walls for a short time(maybe only 1 wall);


conditions:
how many enemies you've killed this room
how many enemies are left in the room
how many bullets you've shot in this room
how many bullets you've shot since (this could be anything, the start or since an upgrade)
how many upgrades in inventory
how many upgrades you've picked up since(again this could be anything)
how many minions you have
how long you've been in a room
facing direction
weapon
bullet speed
enemy health
touching wall?
health
damage
reload speed
time since your last shot
damage dealt since(anything)
how many enemies you've killed since(anything)

outputs:
cooldown time
reload time
damage
effect
chain?
max num of enemies that can be hit
health
invincability frames
bullet/whatever projectile path

power ups that start powerful and slowly lose power

minor power up ideas:
each hit does fires twice as fast, but each hit shrinks the enemy
Chance for bullet to do massive damage
invincable for little bit longer
you do a test(ex: button mashing) and however well you do on it thats how powerful the power up is
get a damage bonus after gaining health
enemies that you've killed orbit you as souls and block 1 hit if they happen to block
enemies can damage each other
grappling hook does damage
money and health always gets sucked towards you
bombs block bullets(might be too overpowered)
the more money you have, more damage.(or maybe other way around)

Major Power ups:
Shoot out balls that orbit around you(similar to souls but this does it on command)
gatling gun, not much range but CRAZY knockback on user

doesn't know what halve cooldown does(make shiny)(change description to "this gun shoots 100% faster than normal" or smth)
make damage display *10 to make it seem better
do something at upgrade shop if buy nothing(heal some HP)
make upgrade text go behind upgrades on upgrade screen 
enemies shoot more weapons
maybe bonus for buying something you've never bought before
make gameplay loop change while you're playing
fix controller support
add shitty explosion gif (only to bosses)
make more damage more powerful than shooting fast(the back and forth gameplay is more intresting)
pathfinding lags on chromebook
draw health towards you slowly(only with magnet?)
make magnet suck up health
add some upgrades that add damage instead of multipling it
add special power ups after the boss
make screen scaling on UI and power up select
don't make enemies spawn by the door
bombs on screen transtions(kinda fixed by making bombs not able to cross room boundaries)
screen shake upgrade
upgrade:hitting enemies heals you a tiny bit (maybe less damage)
more room templates
mirror rooms to be lazy
make a lot more power ups that give sniper a MUCH faster firing rate
implement upgrade rarity
make stronger, rarer versions of minor upgrades
major upgrade that gives you more minor upgrdae slots and nothing else(backpack)
locking in a +5 health shouldn't make you lose 5 health
minor->upgrades
major->gear
oliver thinks locking in should be by 2 each time instead of 5(I think it's working great)
add knockback to bombs and water gun
add a gain $2 button instead of getting an upgrade
start with a sniper to learn the basics of the game
slow down the beginning. Add mechanics slowly.
    make first room only offer 1 major upgrade and the mouse is the only part of the UI visible
    make the mouse blink/glow to show where to drag the ability
    after beating the next room the small slots become visible and it offers you 2 small upgrades
    After beating next room show sell button
    adds all the upgrades as visible
    once you have $5, completed another room, or filled up 5 slots or maybe even just 3, show the locking in UI(I'm not sure what should trigger it)
didn't know:
    What you had to drag or what the bottom even was
    thought the major power ups could be in the small slots: add them one at a time so you learn what each looks like and what it does slowly
full auto aim on controller?
lots more auto aim for ease of new players
buff boss HP a lot
fix art
    make guns look like actual guns
    make everything have a sprite
    make dual wealding look better(maybe ditch dual wealding)
    add a sprite for every enemy
    shop
make elemental combos with items
add controller support for menus and swapping weapons
make moving stuff in the menus not shoot the gun
enemies can still shoot through walls
gun moves back into you like it's got kick
bombs on screen transition is still a problem
make a message pop up if you try to buy something without enough money(maybe make the rects have a time they stay up for)
2 1/4 chances should be independant, not 1/2
make the menus actually work with controllers, not just copying the mouse

online scoreboard
add arrow or something like a glow showing where to go

make lots of room for stupid overpowered stuff
