totorial and how well you do changes the difficulty for the rest of the game
Maybe how you're doing in the game changes the difficulty
enemy that runs away
turn while dashing
dash has to be charged, so you preplan your inputs and do them all in quick seccusion
miku skin

Stats after you beat the final boss
Better graphics
Show how enemies move differently?
Knockback on your shots upgrade
Make AI miss (test with more playtesting to see if this is needed)
Shooting stuns the enemies(this would be an upgrade)
cheese kill boss on wall (bullets dissappear on frame 1 and miss you)(can happen to other enemies too)
enemy with sheild that needs line of sight to turn the sheild (meant to encourage flanking)(enemy can't itself shoot)
enemies (espically boss)show how much health they have left?
screen freeze when you shoot or get hit or hit an enemy(to emphasize the impact)
audio
enemies have more health but no visual indicator that they have more health(this might be ok)(what if enemies only power up after bosses)
when you dash backwards into a wall and shoot the bullet dissapears on frame one
boss needs more depth
particle when a bullet hits anything
upgrade that lets you suck up tiny upgrades
add an image of the weapon on the weapon select screen
boss should have a more unique reward
make better pathfinding that doesn't generate the boxes every time, it uses a preset web
limit on gun reload upgrades?
enemy that charges at you and doesn't turn
windup on machine gun
sniper have unique upgrade where every enemy you pierce makes it do more damage(encourages lining up enemies to snipe em all at once)
make enemy that has full pathfinding but if it has line of sight it moves like the pink enemy
add explosions (suicide bomber and weapon)
test enemy shooting through walls (I don't know what this means)(I think the enemies can shoot through walls like what happened to Miles)
add fast mode(less rooms but the power ups are stronger to compensate)
bullet spread doean't help enough with shotgun
He peeks out from a wall with the shotgun for a easy hit
When he is on low health he plays defensive and boring (more health drops?)
The enemies clump on walls(bad?)
different weapons like  grenade laucher 
homing bullets, their homing strength could be upgradeable
add blood or something that spews out of enemies that is really satifiying to run and collect like the lego games studs
when you try to pick up one you don't have space for, it says something and you have to rearrage your upgrades to be ready
maybe your first upgrade is twice as powerful?
if you hold 3 directional buttons, they don't cancel out and you move diaganolly
improce screen shake, make it more thoughtful instead of just random
you have an ult which power ups can change what it does, charged up killing enemies, maybe with the lego studs idea
make each upgrade an article of clothing so when you have a combo your charecter looks really funny
you shoot every frame so 60 fps shoots more than 30
enemy that has bullets fly away from it(reverse auto aim)
bullets shouldn't be able to shoot through a wall
remove ctx.save and restore with setTransform for performance

REVERSE MAGNET DOES damage 
special slot for weapon?(softlock where you don't have any weapons that do damage is too easy)
when a bullet hits a bomb the bomb explodes
make power ups not specific to a weapon. It doesn't feel good to only get power ups that are just objectively useless,
so turn weapon specific power ups into conditionals ex: bombs do double damage -> explosives do double damage
ex: dash heals you -> moving fast heals you(like REALLY fast)
power ups can take up multiple slots

magic staff? (lighting(chains between enemies), explosives, metal(bullets),water(knockback))
water shoots you back(like the dash)(maybe you charge up a big ball of water)
Upgrade could be a really good enemy teammate
One could be a healer that sits back and throws healing potions at you
Maybe you can still summon weaker enemies with a botton press but there's a limit or thet don't stay with you
control two guys and they both respond to your bottom presses, have to navigate them through a maze
upgrade that makes any enemy you kill go onto your team (maybe only a chance of happening)
Add shield (hitting enemies heals the sheild)
game where the screen rotates and you have to find the player?
you have to scroll the screen to follow the player, the camera doesn't move
steal enemies ability(steal bosses ability to shoot multiple bullets)
you can use the enemies soul as a power up for you, or summon it as a minnon
bullets spinning in a circle made very cool patterns that could be a puzzle?
you have a "deck" or cards 1-9 and one is always randomly drawn. upgrades effect what cards they are and maybe what status effects they do
You have to throw bombs that grow after a set time and the "exploding" bomb(an expanding player) pushs around circles to solve puzzles
You shoot to the beat of the music. maybe you make the music before each level to add startagy. maybe you can't even move and the only thing you have control over when you shoot, in ther words, what the music is
game where you're playing the economy like you're in the gilded age. playing other companies agaist each other
having the circles on the corners of the rotated bullets looks really satifiying on the bombs
every few rooms there is a challenge to mix it up
showing the corners and second corners when a bullet hits a wall looks really cool. When shot directly into a wall that is

resource management
You can change what type of enemy an enemy is
make copies of yourself
parry bullets
bouncing shots
augmentations(minor upgrades can apply to anything) ex: damgage up could affect your bullets or your minions bullets
each major upgrades is a branch
an upgrde that is just a downside for a room then becomes an upgrade(take on a curse for x rooms and have a choice between 3 or so upgrades)

major upgrades are now guns that can all shoot all the bullets
but now each one has effects (maybe profeciency) in one area and a downside in another(ex: shoots another bullet for the shotgun bullet but sniper bullets do half damage)

bullets:
shotgun bullet
poison bullets
water (knockback bullets)(also makes electricity chain between further enemies)
bomb
bullet that splits into 4 smaller bullets
electricity(damage over time that chains)
bouncing bullet
burst of bullets(machine gun)
grapple hook?

Power up ideas
you are invincable for longer
you do more damage while invincable right after taking damage
dash makes you invincable
jump?
shoot through infinite enemies
each enemy your bullet goes through, the damage doubles
you do more damage on lower health
more bullet speed
bullet speeds up as it travels
bullet slows down as it travels
the more enemies a bomb hits at once, the more damage it does
chance of a bullet doing a crit with nice sound or turning into something cool
more range
bullets move as fast as you are moving
bullet speed is porportional to how much damage they do
become more accurate
whenever you get a max health power up, heal to full
homing bullet(there is still bullet range)
another life after death, but you lose most or all of your power ups after death
    maybe it starts as if you die, you keep all the power ups, but the more rooms you beat holding that power up, the more power ups you will lose once you die
    or every time you die you will lose 1 more power up next death
each consecutive shot that hits an enemy does more damage(have to hold?)
invisibility
every room cleared with this, do .5 more damage
turret you can place? shoots health at you?
flamethrower(bullets can leave a lingering flame)
STAR the longer since the last shot, the more damage(up to a limit)(meant to encourage low fire rate builds, not wait in a room to charge up a shot)
bullets explode when hitting a wall(or maybe just on hitting an enemy)
wavy bullets
bullet kick(the amount the move back when shooting) is tripled

trade offs
less range but more bullets(maybe something else)
less fire rate but more damage
less damage but more fire rate
half health, but you take less damge and maybe something else
no auto Aim(maybe also a benifit)
become less accurate but shoot more bullets(or maybe replace that with another advantage)
unlimited screenShake
increased health but also increased size(you get hit more)
more bullets but less invincability frames

ult ideas:

huge explosion centered on you which has a long cooldown
barbarian mode where you heal from damage and barbarian mode is extended when this happens or extended when you get kills
can't move but shoot TONS of bullets(maybe little low damage)(fort knox blu jay idea)
move through walls for a short time(maybe only 1 wall);


conditions:
how many enemies you've killed this room
how many enemies are left in the room
how many bullets you've shot in this room
how many bullets you've shot since (this could be anything, the start or since an upgrade)
how many upgrades in inventory
how many upgrades you've picked up since(again this could be anything)
how many minions you have
how long you've been in a room
facing direction
weapon
bullet speed
enemy health
touching wall?
health
damage
reload speed
time since your last shot
damage dealt since(anything)
how many enemies you've killed since(anything)

outputs:
cooldown time
reload time
damage
effect
chain?
max num of enemies that can be hit
health
invincability frames
bullet/whatever projectile path

power ups that start powerful and slowly lose power

minor power up ideas:
each hit does fires twice as fast, but each hit shrinks the enemy
Chance for bullet to do massive damage
invincable for little bit longer
you do a test(ex: button mashing) and however well you do on it thats how powerful the power up is
get a damage bonus after gaining health
enemies that you've killed orbit you as souls and block 1 hit if they happen to block
enemies can damage each other
grappling hook does damage
money and health always gets sucked towards you
bombs block bullets(might be too overpowered)
the more money you have, more damage.(or maybe other way around)

Major Power ups:
gatling gun, not much range but CRAZY knockback on user

enemies shoot more weapons
maybe bonus for buying something you've never bought before
make gameplay loop change while you're playing
draw health towards you slowly(only with magnet?)
make magnet suck up health
add some upgrades that add damage instead of multipling it
add special power ups after the boss
don't make enemies spawn by the door
upgrade:hitting enemies heals you a tiny bit (maybe less damage)
more room templates
mirror rooms to be lazy
implement upgrade rarity
make stronger, rarer versions of minor upgrades
locking in a +5 health shouldn't make you lose 5 health
add knockback to water gun
add a gain $2 button instead of getting an upgrade(or heal)
didn't know:
    What you had to drag or what the bottom even was
    thought the major power ups could be in the small slots
buff boss HP a lot(maybe not needed)
fix art
    make guns look like actual guns
    make dual wealding look better
    add a sprite for every enemy
    shop
    bosses
    enemies should be holding weapons
    update the art and center the lock on the minor powe ups
make elemental combos with items
add controller support for menus and swapping weapons
make moving stuff in the menus not shoot the gun
enemies can still shoot through walls
gun moves back into you like it's got kick
bombs on screen transition is still a problem
make a message pop up if you try to buy something without enough money(maybe make the rects have a time they stay up for)
2 1/4 chances should be independant, not 1/2
make the menus actually work with controllers, not just copying the mouse
make a controller last frame to consolidate the different variables
bullets have particle when hitting a wall or enemy
things to improve the mouse
    make the power ups screws
    make the power ups usb sticks
    replace the mouse with two arms that repersanet the robots arms
getting a major power up from the first power up select may be sending a mixed message compared to you always getting a minor in every single later one. Maybe have it drop onto you and you pick it up and equip it
shop only appears affter bosses?
make money and stuff not drop from "enemies" you shoot EX: black hole

online scoreboard
add arrow or something like a glow showing where to go

make lots of room for stupid overpowered stuff

story:
You start as a robot that gets off the assembly line and other robots are sent to destroy you
You fight your way through, but whenever you die, it shows you exploding, then zooms out to show that your camera view was actually a on a secreen
shows humans, who have hacked into the factory and every run you take control of a new robot taking down the factory from the inside
